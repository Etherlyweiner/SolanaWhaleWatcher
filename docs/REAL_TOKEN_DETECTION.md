   - Fetch holder data (Helius)
   - Calculate whale concentration
   - Check liquidity (Dexscreener)
   - Calculate rug score
   - Evaluate market metrics
3. Calculate profitability score (0-100)
4. If score >= 60: Send to N8N webhook

**Scan Starting**:

```json
{"ts":"2025-10-26T...","level":"info","ns":"core:scanner","msg":"Starting scan cycle"}
```

**Token Found**:

```json
{"ts":"2025-10-26T...","level":"info","ns":"core:scanner","msg":"🎯 TOKEN FLAGGED","mint":"ABC123...","symbol":"ROCKET","score":85}
```

**Webhook Sent**:

```json
{"ts":"2025-10-26T...","level":"info","ns":"core:scanner","msg":"Webhook notification sent","statusCode":200,"mint":"ABC123..."}
```

**Scan Complete**:

```json
{"ts":"2025-10-26T...","level":"info","ns":"core:scanner","msg":"Scan cycle complete","duration":"3521ms","candidates":12,"flagged":2}
```

### Option 2: Monitor N8N Executions

1. Open: <http://localhost:5678>
2. Click "Executions" (left sidebar)
3. Watch for new workflow runs
4. Click to see data flow

### Option 3: Watch Discord Channel

- Open your Discord channel
- New alerts will appear when tokens meet criteria
- Rich formatted messages with full analysis

## ⏱️ Timing Expectations

### How Long Until First Alert?

**It depends on market conditions**:

- **Active market** (high Pump.fun activity): 5-30 minutes
- **Normal market**: 30-60 minutes  
- **Slow market**: 1-3 hours
- **Very slow market**: May take several hours

**Why the wait?**:

- Scanner needs to find tokens meeting ALL criteria
- Score must be > 75 (high quality bar)
- Pump.fun launches vary by time of day
- Market volatility affects opportunity count

---

## 🔧 Real-Time Commands

### Check Scanner Status

```powershell
# Scanner should show in task manager or use:
Get-Process node
```

### View Recent Logs

Scanner logs appear in the terminal where it's running. Look for:

- `Starting scan cycle` - Scan beginning
- `TOKEN FLAGGED` - Found a candidate!
- `Webhook notification sent` - Sent to N8N
- `Scan cycle complete` - Scan finished

### Test Webhook Again

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-webhook.ps1
```

### Restart Scanner (if needed)

```bash
# Stop current scanner (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Or kill the process

# Start fresh:
npm run scan
```

## 🎯 What to Do When You Get an Alert

### Step 1: Review the Alert

- Check the score (higher = better)
- Review the analysis reasons
- Look at whale concentration
- Check liquidity and volume

### Step 2: Verify on DEX Screener

- Click the DEX Screener link
- Verify chart pattern
- Check holder distribution
- Review recent trades

### Step 3: Make Your Decision

**This is information, not financial advice**. Use the alert as:

- Starting point for research
- Early warning system
- Data for your strategy

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### No Alerts After 1 Hour?

**Check**:

1. Scanner still running: `Get-Process node`
2. N8N container running: `docker ps`
3. Workflow is Active in N8N
4. Check scan logs for errors
5. Market may be slow (normal)

### Scanner Crashed?

```bash
# Restart it:
npm run scan
```

### Webhook Failing?

```bash
# Test connection:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-webhook.ps1
```

### Too Many Alerts?

Increase the score threshold in N8N:

1. Open workflow in N8N
2. Click "High Score Filter" node
3. Change `75` to `80` or `85`
4. Save workflow

### Too Few Alerts?

Decrease the score threshold:

1. Open workflow in N8N
2. Click "High Score Filter" node
3. Change `75` to `70` or `65`
4. Save workflow

---

## 📈 Optimization Tips

### Adjust Scan Frequency

```bash
# Faster scans (every 30 seconds):
npm run scan -- --interval=30

# Slower scans (every 120 seconds):
npm run scan -- --interval=120
```

**Note**: Faster = more API calls, may hit rate limits

### Adjust Score Threshold

Edit N8N workflow "High Score Filter" node:

- **More selective**: Increase to 80-85
- **More alerts**: Decrease to 65-70
- **Current**: 75 (recommended)

### Monitor Multiple Channels

Create multiple Discord webhooks for different score ranges:

- High priority: Score > 85
- Medium priority: Score 75-85
- Watch list: Score 60-75

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

- ✅ Scanner console shows "Scan cycle complete" every 60s
