# 🚀 Tonight's Action Plan - Get Fully Operational

## 🎯 Goal
Fix data mapping → Restart scanner with debug → Find tokens → See alerts in Discord!

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Fix N8N Workflow (2 minutes)

### Action: Import Fixed Workflow

1. **Open N8N**: http://localhost:5678
2. **Import New Workflow**:
   - Click "+ Add workflow"
   - Click ⋮ menu → "Import from File"
   - Select: `n8n-workflows\whale-watcher-discord-FIXED.json`
   - Click "Save"
   - Click "Activate" toggle
3. **Deactivate Old Workflow**:
   - Go to "Workflows"
   - Find old "Whale Watcher - Discord Alerts"
   - Toggle OFF

### Test It Works:
```bash
node test-with-real-token.js
```

**Expected Discord Message:**
- ✅ Symbol: SOL
- ✅ Score: 85/100
- ✅ Price: $150.25
- ✅ Liquidity: $5,000,000
- ✅ All data showing correctly!

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Restart Scanner with Debug Logging (1 minute)

### Action: Start Scanner

```bash
cd c:\Users\Jonat\SolanaWhaleWatcher
npm run scan -- --interval=60
```

### What to Watch For in Logs:

Look for these messages:
```
"Fetching latest pairs from Dexscreener"
"Dexscreener response received" { totalProfiles: 30 }
"Filtered Solana tokens" { count: 26 }
"Returning formatted tokens" { count: 26 }
"Dexscreener candidates" { count: 26 }
```

**If you see this** → Scanner is finding tokens! ✅

**If you see 0 candidates** → We need to debug further

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Analyze Scanner Output (3 minutes)

### Scenario A: Scanner Finds Candidates (BEST CASE)

**Logs show:**
```
"candidates": 26
"flagged": 0
```

**This means**: Tokens found but none scored > 75

**Quick Fix**: Lower N8N threshold temporarily
1. Open N8N workflow
2. Change filter from `> 75` to `> 60`
3. Save and restart
4. **You'll see alerts within 60 seconds!**

### Scenario B: Scanner Shows 0 Candidates (NEEDS DEBUG)

**Logs show:**
```
"candidates": 0
```

**This means**: Dexscreener data not flowing

**Debug steps:**
1. Check if `getLatestPairs()` is being called
2. Check if tokens have `mint` addresses
3. Check provider initialization

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Quick Wins Based on Results

### Option A: Tokens Found, Score Too High (5 min fix)
Lower threshold in N8N from 75 → 60

### Option B: No Tokens Found (10 min fix)
Add more debug logging to see exact issue

### Option C: Everything Works! (0 min fix)
🎉 System operational! Just wait for alerts!

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**After completing these steps, you should see:**

1. ✅ Test alert in Discord with correct data
2. ✅ Scanner logs showing candidates found
3. ✅ Real token alerts flowing to Discord
4. ✅ **Fully operational whale detection system!**

---

## 🔧 Commands Reference

### Test Webhook
```bash
node test-with-real-token.js
```

### Start Scanner
```bash
npm run scan -- --interval=60
```

### Check N8N
http://localhost:5678

### Check Discord
Look for "Whale watcher bot" messages

---

## 🎯 Time Estimate

- **STEP 1**: 2 minutes (import workflow)
- **STEP 2**: 1 minute (start scanner)
- **STEP 3**: 3 minutes (analyze logs)
- **STEP 4**: 5-10 minutes (apply fix)

**Total**: 11-16 minutes to full operation! 🚀

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep N8N open** - Watch executions in real-time
2. **Keep PowerShell open** - Watch scanner logs
3. **Keep Discord open** - See alerts as they come
4. **If stuck** - Check the debug logs first, they tell you everything
