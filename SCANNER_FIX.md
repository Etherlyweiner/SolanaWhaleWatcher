# ðŸ”§ Scanner Fix - Pump.fun API Down

## ðŸš¨ Root Cause

**Pump.fun API is completely unavailable:**
- All endpoints returning errors (530, 503)
- Scanner has been running 1+ hour with 0 candidates found
- This is why you haven't seen any token alerts

---

## âœ… Solution: Use Dexscreener New Pairs Instead

Dexscreener has a "latest pairs" endpoint that shows new token launches on Solana.

### Quick Fix (5 minutes)

I'll modify the scanner to use Dexscreener's `/latest/dex/pairs/solana` endpoint instead of Pump.fun.

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Dexscreener API is working (we tested it - 200 OK)
- âœ… Shows new Solana token pairs
- âœ… Includes liquidity and volume data
- âœ… No API key required
- âœ… Better data quality (only lists tokens with actual DEX pairs)

**Trade-offs:**
- Only shows tokens that have DEX liquidity
- Might miss some ultra-new Pump.fun launches (but those are risky anyway)
- Better data quality = fewer but higher quality candidates

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Options

### Option A: Modify Scanner to Use Dexscreener (RECOMMENDED)

**What I'll do:**
1. Update scanner to fetch from Dexscreener `/latest/dex/pairs/solana`
2. Filter for tokens < 15 minutes old
3. Use existing Helius provider for holder data
4. Keep all other scoring logic the same

**Time**: 10 minutes
**Risk**: Low (Dexscreener is proven working)

### Option B: Wait for Pump.fun to Come Back Online

**What happens:**
- Keep scanner running
- Hope Pump.fun API recovers
- Could be hours or days

**Time**: Unknown
**Risk**: Wasting more time

### Option C: Add Both Sources (Future Enhancement)

**What we could do:**
- Try Pump.fun first
- Fall back to Dexscreener if Pump.fun fails
- Best of both worlds

**Time**: 30 minutes
**Risk**: More complex

## ðŸ’¡ My Recommendation

**Do Option A RIGHT NOW:**
1. I'll modify the scanner to use Dexscreener
2. Restart scanner with working data source
3. Start seeing tokens within minutes
4. Add Pump.fun fallback later when it's back online

This gets you operational IMMEDIATELY instead of waiting indefinitely for Pump.fun.

## ðŸ“Š What You'll Get

**After the fix:**
- Scanner will find new Solana token pairs from Dexscreener
- Same scoring system (whales, liquidity, rug score)
- Same N8N webhook integration
- Same Discord alerts
- **WORKING within 5 minutes!**

**Quality improvement:**
- Dexscreener only lists tokens with actual DEX pairs
- Better liquidity data
- More established tokens (safer)
- Still very fresh (< 15 min old)

## ðŸš€ Ready to Fix?

**Say the word and I'll:**
1. Modify the scanner code (10 min)
2. Restart the scanner
3. You'll see first token alert within 5-15 minutes
