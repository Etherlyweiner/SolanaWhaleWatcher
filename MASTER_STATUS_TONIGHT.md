# 🎯 MASTER STATUS - Tonight's Breakthrough!

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED

**Discord showed**: "Symbol: Unknown, Score: 0/100, all N/A values"

**Root Cause Found**: N8N Webhook v2 nests POST data under `body` object
- Workflow looked for: `$json.score` ❌
- Actual location: `$json.body.score` ✅

## ✅ THE SOLUTION

**Created Fixed Workflow**: `whale-watcher-discord-FIXED.json`
- All references changed from `$json.field` → `$json.body.field`
- Ready to import and test

## 🎯 YOUR PATH TO SUCCESS (15 minutes)

### Phase 1: Fix N8N Data Mapping (3 min)
1. Open http://localhost:5678
2. Import `n8n-workflows\whale-watcher-discord-FIXED.json`
3. Activate new workflow, deactivate old one
4. Test: `node test-with-real-token.js`
5. ✅ See correct data in Discord!

### Phase 2: Start Scanner with Debug (2 min)
1. Run: `npm run scan -- --interval=60`
2. Watch logs for Dexscreener activity
3. Look for "candidates" count

### Phase 3: Analyze & Optimize (10 min)
- If candidates > 0 but no alerts → Lower threshold to 60
- If candidates = 0 → Check debug logs
- If everything works → 🎉 You're done!
