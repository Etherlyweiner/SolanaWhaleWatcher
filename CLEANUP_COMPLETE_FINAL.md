**Audience**: Advanced users, whale tracking enthusiasts

**Status**: Maintained for backward compatibility

#### 2. Unified Scanner (`unifiedTokenScanner.js`) - PRIMARY ‚≠ê
**Command**: `npm run scan:unified`

**Purpose**: Monitor ALL DEX launches across Solana

**Uses**:
- `dexscreenerProviderEnhanced` - ALL DEX data aggregation
- Single source of truth

**Audience**: All users, maximum coverage

**Status**: RECOMMENDED, production-ready

---

## üì¶ Active Providers

### Core Providers (In Use)

1. **`dexscreenerProvider.js`**
   - Used by: Original scanner
   - Purpose: Market data from Dexscreener
   - Status: Active, stable

2. **`dexscreenerProviderEnhanced.js`** ‚≠ê
   - Used by: Unified scanner
   - Purpose: Enhanced Dexscreener aggregation (ALL DEXes)
   - Status: NEW, primary provider

3. **`heliusProvider.js`**
   - Used by: Original scanner, analysis functions
   - Purpose: On-chain holder data
   - Status: Essential, no replacement

4. **`pumpfunProvider.js`**
   - Used by: Original scanner (as fallback)
   - Purpose: Pump.fun launches
   - Status: Legacy, minimal use, kept for scanner.js

### Independent Providers (Not Related to Cleanup)

## üéØ Command Structure

### Before Cleanup
```bash
npm run scan              # Original whale scanner
npm run scan:newpools     # Raydium-only scanner ‚ùå
npm run scan:graduations  # Would error (never implemented)
npm run scan:unified      # Unified Dexscreener scanner
```

### After Cleanup ‚úÖ
```bash
npm run scan          # Original whale scanner (whale focus)
npm run scan:unified  # Unified Dexscreener scanner (ALL DEXes - RECOMMENDED)
```

**Simple, clean, focused.**

## üöÄ Recommended Usage

### For New Users (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Start the unified scanner (ALL DEXes)
npm run scan:unified
```

**Why**: 
- Monitors Pump.fun, Raydium, Orca, Meteora, and ALL Solana DEXes
- Maximum coverage (3-5x more opportunities)
- Single, stable API (Dexscreener)
- $0 cost, no API keys required
- Simple and reliable

### For Advanced Users

```bash
# Start the original whale scanner
npm run scan
```

**Why**:
- Sophisticated whale activity detection
- Tracks holder concentration and accumulation
- Useful for specific whale-following strategies
- More complex scoring algorithm

### Run Both (Maximum Coverage)

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run scan

# Terminal 2
npm run scan:unified
```

**Why**:
- Different strategies complement each other
- Whale scanner = quality focus
- Unified scanner = quantity focus
- No conflicts (different data sources)

## üåê The Unified Approach

**Your insight was correct**: Use Dexscreener to access everything!

**Why it works**:
- Dexscreener aggregates ALL Solana DEXes
- Single API call gets Pump.fun, Raydium, Orca, Meteora, etc.
- More stable than individual DEX APIs
- Free, no authentication required
- Complete data in every response

**Result**: Simpler code, better coverage, zero cost.
