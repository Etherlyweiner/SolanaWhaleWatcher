## 🚀 What's Happening Right Now

### Scanner (Already Running) ✅
- **Status**: Active and finding tokens
- **Location**: PowerShell window (Command ID: 1635)
- **Frequency**: Scans every 60 seconds
- **Candidates**: Finding ~22 tokens per cycle
- **Action Needed**: NONE - Leave it running!

### What Scanner Does:
1. Every 60 seconds, fetches latest 30 Solana tokens from Dexscreener
2. Filters for tokens with valid mint addresses
3. Evaluates each token (whale activity, liquidity, rug score)
4. Assigns score 0-100
5. If score > 60 → Sends to N8N webhook
6. N8N → Filters → Discord

---

## 📊 PowerShell Terminal - What You See

**Your scanner window should show:**
```
"Starting scan cycle"
"Discovered candidates" { count: 22 }
"Scan cycle complete" { candidates: 22, flagged: 0-5 }
```

**What each means:**
- `candidates: 22` = Found 22 tokens ✅
- `flagged: 0` = None scored > 60 yet
- `flagged: 1+` = Token(s) sent to Discord! 🎉

---

## ⏱️ Expected Timeline

| Time | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Right Now** | Scanner finding candidates every 60s |
| **Within 5 min** | First token scores > 60 |
| **When it happens** | N8N workflow triggers |
| **Immediately after** | Discord alert appears |

---

## 🎯 What You'll See in Discord

When a token scores > 60, you'll get:

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### 1. Scanner Logs (PowerShell)
Watch for `flagged: 1` or higher

### 2. N8N Executions
- Open: http://localhost:5678
- Click "Executions" in sidebar
- See green checkmarks when workflow runs

### 3. Discord Channel
Watch for "Whale watcher bot" messages

---

## ⚠️ If No Alerts After 5 Minutes

### Check 1: Scanner Finding Candidates?
Look at PowerShell: `candidates: 22` means YES ✅

### Check 2: Any Flagged?
Look for `flagged: 1` or higher

**If flagged: 0**
- Tokens aren't scoring > 60 yet
- This is normal - wait for better market activity
- OR lower threshold to 50 for more alerts

### Check 3: N8N Workflow Active?
1. Open N8N: http://localhost:5678
2. Click "Workflows"
3. Verify "Whale Watcher - Discord Alerts (FIXED)" has green toggle

### Check 4: Discord Webhook Valid?
The workflow uses your Discord webhook URL - should be correct

---

## 🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. ✅ PowerShell shows `flagged: 1` or higher
2. ✅ N8N executions show green checkmark
3. ✅ Discord alert appears with real token data
4. ✅ Token data is NOT "Unknown" or "N/A"

---

## 🛠️ PowerShell Actions

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Close the PowerShell window (scanner will stop)
- Press Ctrl+C (stops scanner)
- Run any commands in that window

### ✅ DO:
- **Leave it running**
- Watch the logs
- Open a NEW PowerShell window if you need to run commands
