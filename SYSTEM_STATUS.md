## 🔄 Data Flow (Active)

```
1. Scanner discovers Pump.fun launches
         ↓
2. Evaluates: whale concentration, liquidity, rug score
         ↓
3. Calculates score (0-100)
         ↓
4. If score >= 60: POST to N8N webhook
         ↓
5. N8N receives data at /webhook/whale-watcher
         ↓
6. Filters: Only processes if score > 75
         ↓
7. Formats rich message with:
   - Token symbol & score
   - Analysis reasons
   - Market data (price, volume, liquidity)
   - Whale metrics (top 5 concentration, holders)
   - Launch info (age, rug score)
   - DEX Screener link
         ↓
8. Sends to Discord via HTTP Request
         ↓
9. ✅ Alert appears in your Discord channel!

# To stop: Ctrl+C in the terminal

# To start manually:
npm run scan

# With custom interval (seconds):
npm run scan -- --interval=60
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### When Scanner Finds a Token

**Console Output**:
```json
{"ts":"2025-10-25T...","level":"info","ns":"core:scanner","msg":"🎯 TOKEN FLAGGED","mint":"ABC...","score":85}
{"ts":"2025-10-25T...","level":"info","ns":"core:scanner","msg":"Webhook notification sent","statusCode":200}
```

**N8N Executions**:
- New execution appears
- Shows data flowing through 3 nodes
- Success status

**Discord**:
- Rich formatted message appears
- Contains all token details
- DEX Screener link included

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You know everything is working when you see:

- ✅ Scanner console: `Webhook notification sent { statusCode: 200 }`
- ✅ N8N Executions: New runs appearing
- ✅ Discord: Token alerts with scores > 75

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If No Alerts Appear

**Check**:
1. Scanner is finding tokens (may take time)
2. Tokens meet score threshold (>75 for Discord)
3. N8N workflow is "Active" (green toggle)
4. Check N8N Executions for errors

### If Webhook Fails

**Run test**:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test-webhook.ps1
```

**Expected**: Status 200
