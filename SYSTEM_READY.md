## 📊 WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

### Scanner Activity
- **Status**: Active and scanning every 60 seconds
- **Candidates Found**: 22 tokens per cycle
- **Data Source**: Dexscreener (primary)
- **Evaluation**: Running on all candidates

### Expected Behavior
- Tokens scoring > 20 will trigger N8N
- N8N will send to Discord
- **First alert expected within 1-5 minutes**

---

## 🔍 HOW TO MONITOR

### 1. Scanner Logs (PowerShell Window)
**Watch for:**
```json
"candidates": 22
"flagged": 0    ← Waiting for score > 20
"flagged": 1+   ← ALERT SENT! Check Discord!
```

### 2. N8N Executions
**URL**: http://localhost:5678
- Click "Executions" in left sidebar
- Green checkmark = Success
- Click execution to see data

### 3. Discord Channel
**Watch for**: "Whale watcher bot" messages
**Expected format**:
```
🎯 Profitable Token Detected!

Symbol: [TOKEN]
Score: 25/100
Mint: [ADDRESS]

Market Data:
💰 Price: $X.XX
💧 Liquidity: $XXX,XXX
📊 24h Volume: $XXX,XXX
```

---

## ⚠️ EXPECTED WARNINGS (Normal)

You may see these in scanner logs - **they're NORMAL**:

1. **Pump.fun 404**: API is down, using Dexscreener instead ✅
2. **Helius 429**: Free tier rate limit, using fallbacks ✅
3. **Some N/A values**: Limited by data availability ✅

**These don't prevent alerts from working!**

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS

### You'll Know It's Working When:

**Scanner Window Shows:**
```json
"flagged": 1
```

**N8N Shows:**
- New execution with green checkmark
- Timestamp matches scanner log

**Discord Shows:**
- New message from "Whale watcher bot"
- Token information populated
- Real mint address shown

---

## 📈 CURRENT SCORING LOGIC

### How Tokens Are Evaluated (Max 100 points)

**Market Momentum** (20 points max)
- ✅ Strong volume: +10 points
- ✅ Volume spike: +10 points
- **Status**: WORKING

**Whale Activity** (45 points max)
- ⚠️ Whale concentration: +25 points
- ⚠️ Whales accumulating: +20 points
- **Status**: Limited by rate limits

**Launch Characteristics** (45 points max)
- ❌ Low rug score: +20 points
- ❌ High liquidity: +15 points
- ❌ Low team share: +10 points
- **Status**: Pump.fun API down

**Why Threshold is 20:**
With current data availability, tokens typically score 10-30 points (mostly from market data). Threshold of 20 ensures you see alerts while the system proves itself.

## 🔧 IF NO ALERTS AFTER 10 MINUTES

### Troubleshooting Steps:

**1. Check Scanner**
```powershell
# Look at PowerShell window
# Should see: "candidates": 22, "flagged": X
```

**2. Check N8N**
- Open: http://localhost:5678
- Click "Executions"
- Any green checkmarks?

**3. Check Workflow Active**
- Open: http://localhost:5678
- Click "Workflows"
- Verify "FIXED" workflow has green toggle

**4. Test Manually**
```powershell
node test-with-real-token.js
```
Should return 200 OK and show alert in Discord

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Right Now (Next 10 minutes)
1. ✅ Keep scanner window open
2. ✅ Keep Discord open
3. ✅ Watch for `"flagged": 1` in logs
4. ✅ Check Discord for first alert
5. 🎉 Celebrate when it arrives!

### After First Alert
1. Review alert quality
2. Adjust threshold if needed (higher/lower)
3. Monitor for patterns
4. Document interesting tokens

### This Weekend
1. Add more data sources (GMGN, Nansen)
2. Implement better caching
3. Create status dashboard
4. Fine-tune evaluation criteria
