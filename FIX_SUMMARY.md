# üîß Scanner Fix Summary - Token Detection Issue

## üö® Problem Identified

**Root Cause**: Pump.fun API is completely down (Error 530 - Cloudflare block)  
**Result**: Scanner ran for 1+ hour finding 0 candidates  
**Time Lost**: ~70 minutes with no alerts

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Modified Dexscreener Provider** (`src/data/providers/dexscreenerProvider.js`)
   - Added `getLatestPairs()` method
   - Uses `/token-profiles/latest/v1` endpoint
   - Returns newest Solana tokens

2. **Updated Scanner** (`src/core/scanner.js`)
   - Primary source: Dexscreener (working)
   - Fallback: Pump.fun (if it comes back online)
   - Scans every 60 seconds

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

**Scanner is running BUT still showing 0 candidates**

### Possible Reasons

1. **Dexscreener token-profiles endpoint** may not be the right one for "latest launches"
   - This endpoint shows promoted/featured tokens
   - NOT necessarily new launches

2. **Need different Dexscreener endpoint**
   - `/latest/dex/search?q=SOL` works but requires search query
   - May need to use trending or boosted tokens
   - Or fetch specific known new pairs

3. **Scanner criteria too strict**
   - Even with new data source, < 15 min age filter is very tight
   - Most Dexscreener tokens already have some age

---

## üéØ Next Steps - Choose One

### Option A: Lower Age Threshold (QUICKEST)

Change scanner to accept tokens up to 60 minutes old instead of 15:

```javascript
// In scanner.js SCAN_CRITERIA
maxAgeMinutes: 60,  // Changed from 15
```

**Pros**: More candidates immediately  
**Cons**: Less "fresh" tokens

### Option B: Use Dexscreener Search + Loop

Fetch Solana pairs by searching for common terms:
- Search for "PUMP", "MOON", "DOGE", etc.
- Get latest results
- Filter by creation time

**Pros**: More targeted  
**Cons**: May miss some tokens

### Option C: Skip Age Filter Temporarily

Comment out age filter to see if scanner finds ANY tokens:

```javascript
// Temporarily disable age check to test
// if (!pair.pairCreatedAt || ageMinutes <= SCAN_CRITERIA.maxAgeMinutes) {
  candidates.push({...})
// }
```

**Pros**: Proves system works  
**Cons**: Will get older tokens

### Option D: Wait for Pump.fun (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Just wait for Pump.fun API to come back online.

**Pros**: None  
**Cons**: Unknown timeline, wasted time

---

## üí° My Recommendation

**Do Option C + A:**

1. **Remove age filter** temporarily to prove scanner works
2. **Lower threshold** to 60 minutes
3. **Test for 5 minutes** - should see candidates immediately
4. **Restore age filter** once confirmed working
5. **Adjust threshold** based on results

This gets you operational NOW with data flowing, then we optimize.

## üîß Quick Fix Code

Want me to implement Option C + A right now? I can have it working in 2 minutes.

**Scanner will:**
- Find tokens from Dexscreener
- Accept tokens up to 60 min old
- Start sending alerts immediately
- Prove the whole system works end-to-end

**Say "yes" and I'll implement it!** üöÄ
